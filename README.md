```

## Completed modules

### Authentication and access control
- Multi-role login for buyer, farmer, and admin
- JWT authentication with protected routes
- Suspended-user handling and role checks

### Cart and orders
- Add, update, remove, and summarize cart items
- Buyer checkout and order placement
- Farmer order review, accept/reject, and status progression
- Buyer order history, cancellation, and order tracking

### Blockchain integration
- Product registration on-chain
- Escrow-based purchases and delivery confirmation
- Refund flow for cancelled orders
- Ownership history and traceability getters

### Admin panel
- Dashboard cards and analytics
- User management with search, suspend, and delete
- Product moderation with approve/block/delete
- Order management and dispute visibility

### UI polish
- Consistent cards, responsive layouts, empty states, and loading states
- Role-based navigation and modern agriculture styling

## Tech stack

- Mobile: React Native, Expo Router, TypeScript
- API: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT
- Blockchain: Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js

## Setup

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

### Mobile app
```bash
cd farm-marketplace
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npx expo start
```

### Blockchain
```bash
cd blockchain
npm install
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat test
```

## Environment variables

### Backend
- PORT
- MONGODB_URI
- JWT_SECRET
- JWT_EXPIRE
- ETHEREUM_NODE_URL or BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL
- ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY or PRIVATE_KEY
- CONTRACT_ADDRESS

### Frontend
- EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL

## Notes

- The backend automatically falls back to database-only mode if blockchain configuration is missing.
- The blockchain service is designed to work with a local Hardhat node or a configured RPC endpoint.

## Verification

The current implementation was verified with:
```bash
cd backend && npm run build
cd blockchain && npx hardhat test
```

# 🚀 Latest Development Progress

## ✅ Completed Features

### 🛒 Order Management

Successfully implemented and verified the complete order placement workflow.

### Features Completed

- Buyer can place orders successfully.
- Orders are stored in MongoDB.
- Unique order numbers are automatically generated.
- Order details include:
  - Order Number
  - Buyer
  - Farmer
  - Product Details
  - Quantity
  - Total Amount
  - Payment Method
  - Shipping Address
  - Order Status
  - Created Date

---

## 🔧 Backend Improvements

### Order Number Generation

Fixed an issue where order creation failed due to the required `orderNumber` field not being generated before validation.

### Root Cause

- Mongoose validated the document before `orderNumber` was assigned.
- Validation failed because `orderNumber` was `undefined`.

### Solution

Implemented automatic order number generation inside the Order model before validation.

Example Format:

```text
ORD-<timestamp>-<random>
```

Example:

```text
ORD-MS5L9LXM-UPHH
```

Result:

- No frontend changes required.
- Every new order receives a unique order number automatically.
- Order creation now completes successfully.

---

## 🗄 Database

Verified successful storage of orders in MongoDB.

Each order now stores:

- Order Number
- Buyer Information
- Farmer Information
- Ordered Products
- Total Amount
- Payment Method
- Shipping Address
- Order Status
- Created Timestamp

---

## 🔗 Backend Verification

Verified:

- Backend starts successfully.
- MongoDB connection established.
- Order creation API returns success.
- Orders persist correctly in the database.
